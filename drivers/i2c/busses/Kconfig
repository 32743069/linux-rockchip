		This supports the use of the I2C interface on rk2818
		processors.

		Using low I2C clock rates may partially work around those issues
		on some systems. Another serious problem is that there is no
		documented way to issue repeated START conditions, as needed
		to support combined I2C messages. Use the i2c-gpio driver
		unless your system can cope with those limitations.
